This code was used for the analysis of an outward-protruding point absorber at the University of Plymouth. 

The code is 'as-is' so if using, you will need to adapt the code.

For regular wave testing, please read 01_README_RegularWave.md for a breakdown of the code, where RAO for a single frequency and mean power is calculated.
Similarly, look at 01_README_RegularWave.md for the irregualr wave analysis, which calculates the RAO for a range of frquencies, and the mean power for the test run. 

For converting the regular wave results from model scale to full scale, see 'Converter2.m', which calculates the output results from the regular wave script.
